Project Overview "SoLoVe"
Solana Web3 Dating Bot is a cutting-edge Telegram bot that leverages the Solana blockchain to create a decentralized and transparent dating experience. The bot integrates Web3 technology using Solana blockchain to verify users through Phantom wallet integration, reward engagement with tokens, and record matches as immutable events on the blockchain.

Technical Implementation
Programming Language and Libraries
Core Language: Python 3.9+
Telegram Interface: python-telegram-bot v20.0
Blockchain Connection: Solana Web3 simulation (DevNet mode)
Database: MongoDB simulation (for demo purposes)
Asynchronous Operations: asyncio
Architecture
The bot implements a conversation-based architecture with state management:
ConversationHandler: Manages user dialog flow
State Management: Tracks user position in conversation flow
Mock Database: Simulates data persistence for demo purposes
Blockchain Integration: Simulates Solana DevNet transactions
Web3 Integration Details
Wallet Verification: Two-step verification process (address + test transaction)
On-Chain Storage: Match events are recorded with transaction hashes
Token Economy: Both earning (registration, active usage) and spending (premium features)
NFT Issuance: Unique tokens for engagement metrics (time spent, likes given, swipes)
Blockchain Explorer Integration: Links to view match transactions on Solana Explorer
Requirements
Software Requirements

Development Logic
The development approach prioritized:
Modular Design: Separate components for Telegram interactions, matching algorithms, and blockchain integration
Asynchronous Processing: Non-blocking operations for responsive user experience
Simulated Blockchain: DevNet integration for demonstration without real cryptocurrency risk
Extensible Architecture: Easy addition of new features, matching criteria, and engagement rewards
Error Resilience: Multiple retry mechanisms and comprehensive error handling
For Hackathon Judges
This project demonstrates innovative integration of social networking and blockchain technologies:
Privacy-First Approach: Personal dating data stored securely on blockchain
Incentivized Engagement: Token rewards for platform participation
Decentralized Match Records: Immutable storage of connection history
Tokenized Premium Dating Services: Blockchain-based marketplace for enhanced features
To evaluate the demo:
Start the bot with /start
Connect a Phantom wallet (or skip)
Create your dating profile
Receive blockchain-verified matches
Explore premium features with earned tokens
The demo runs in simulation mode, so no real Solana transactions are made, and no MongoDB connection is required.
